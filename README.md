# Hand-Gesture
This project uses computer vision with OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand movements in real time via a laptop camera. It detects hand landmarks (fingers, joints, palm) and enables gesture-based interactions like controlling the mouse cursor or adjusting volume with pinching/stretching.
